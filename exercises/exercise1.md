# explorational programming

Let's use pry to explore within some ruby objects we already know.  We'll also learn a little bit about scope.

In your terminal, start pry.
```bash
$ pry
```

1. Create a method called `hello_world`.  Call the method.

2. Use `find-method` to show all the `to_s` methods.  Also try `find-method --help`.

3. Create a hash, and save it as `my_hash`
  ```ruby
  my_hash = { username: 'webdev', email: 'webmaster@example.com' }
  ```

4. Explore your hash using the `cd` and `ls` commands.  Try to call some of the listed instance methods available to you, such as `keys`.
  ```ruby
  cd my_hash
  ls
  ```

5. While still inside `my_hash`, add a new instance method called `crazy_hash` that `puts 'crazy'`.  Then `cd ..` out of `my_hash` and try to call `crazy_hash`.  

6. What object is `crazy_hash` bound to?  Do you think it will exist on new instances of Hash?
